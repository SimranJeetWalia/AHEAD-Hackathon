Here's the Terraform code based on the provided architecture diagram and specifications:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

module "vpc" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = "~> 3.0"

  name = "my-vpc"
  cidr = "192.168.0.0/16"

  azs            = ["us-east-1a"]
  public_subnets = ["192.168.1.0/24"]

  enable_nat_gateway = false
  enable_vpn_gateway = false

  tags = {
    Terraform = "true"
    Environment = "dev"
  }
}

module "ec2_instance" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/ec2-instance/aws"
  version = "~> 3.0"

  name = "web-server"

  ami                    = "ami-085ad6ae776d8f09c"
  instance_type          = "t3.micro"
  key_name               = "user1"
  monitoring             = true
  vpc_security_group_ids = [module.vpc.default_security_group_id]
  subnet_id              = module.vpc.public_subnets[0]

  tags = {
    Terraform   = "true"
    Environment = "dev"
  }
}

resource "aws_internet_gateway" "main" {
  vpc_id = module.vpc.vpc_id

  tags = {
    Name = "main"
  }
}

resource "aws_route" "internet_access" {
  route_table_id         = module.vpc.public_route_table_ids[0]
  destination_cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
  gateway_id             = aws_internet_gateway.main.id
}
```

This Terraform code creates:

1. A VPC with the specified CIDR block
2. A public subnet within the VPC
3. An EC2 instance in the public subnet
4. An Internet Gateway attached to the VPC
5. A route in the public route table to allow internet access

Note that Route53 configuration is skipped as per the provided specifications. The code uses the specified modules where applicable (VPC and EC2 instance). Additional services, auto-scaling, Elastic IP, web server configuration, and JMeter integration are not included as they were not specified in the requirements.
